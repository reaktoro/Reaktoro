# Introduction

Reaktoro is a unified framework for modeling chemically reactive systems.

Below are some features and modeling capabilities of Reaktoro:

* support to several thermochemical databases;
  * PHREEQC
  * SUPCRT
  * SUPCRTBL
  * NASA
  * ThermoFun
* support to chemical equilibrium and kinetics calculations with general constraints;
* efficient numerical algorithms implemented using modern programming techniques;
* the chemical systems can contain any number of phases;
* no limitations on the number of chemical species in each phase;
* use of automatic differentiation for computation of derivatives with respect to virtually any variable or parameter.

For more information on how to install and use Reaktoro, you should go to [Reaktoro's website](https://www.reaktoro.org).
