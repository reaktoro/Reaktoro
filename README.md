# Introduction

Reaktoro is a unified framework for modeling chemically reactive systems.

Below are some features and modeling capabilities of Reaktoro:

* support to several [thermochemical databases](TODO_ADD_LINK_TO_SUPPORTED_THERMODYNAMIC_DATABASES);
  * PHREEQC
  * SUPCRT
  * SUPCRTBL
  * ThermoFun
* support to chemical equilibrium calculations with general constraints;
* support to chemical kinetic calculations;
* efficient numerical algorithms implemented using modern programming techniques;
* the chemical systems can contain any number of phases;
* no limitations on the number of chemical species in each phase;
* use of automatic differentiation for computation of derivatives with respect to virtually any variable or parameter.

> Note: Chemical kinetic calculations are not yet supported in v2.0rc. Use
> Reaktoro v1.0+ if you need them.

We would love to have you as a contributor too, see
[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.rst) for more information.

<!-- ## Developing Quick-Start  TODO: Update this section in README

In order to start developing, you'll need to build Reaktoro from
sources. There are two ways: install the dependencies manually, as
described [here](http://www.reaktoro.org/installation.html), or using
Conda. [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) is a tool for managing packages,
dependencies and environments for multiple languages, including Python
and C++, and supporting multiple platforms: Windows, Linux and macOS. In
order to start developing Reaktoro using Conda, these are the steps:

1. Install Miniconda, pick the 64-bit installer that uses the latest Python
   version from: [conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
2. Add `conda-forge` as a channel:
   `conda config --append channels conda-forge`
3. Install `conda-devenv`: `conda install -n base conda-devenv`
4. Create an environment for Reaktoro, from the repository root
   directory: `conda devenv`
5. Activate the environment: `source activate reaktoro` from
   Linux/macOS or `activate reaktoro` from Windows
6. Create a `build` directory and call `cmake` from it (for now check
   the <span class="title-ref">.travis.yml</span> file for an example
   on CMake parameters), OR, on Windows, call the `inv msvc` task to
   generate a project under `build\msvc` directory, open it in the IDE
   and build the `INSTALL` project. (`inv` is short for `invoke`, from
   the [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) tool.) -->

### Proposing new features

You have a wish list for the Reaktoro development team (e.g.,
implementing certain modeling capabilities, supporting some specific
thermodynamic databases) and you want to propose that to us. You can do
so by going to [Reaktoro's GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/reaktoro/reaktoro/issues/new) and describing
there your desired new feature.

We'll do our best to get your proposed new features implemented.
Understand, however, that we have limited resources and a tight schedule
for ongoing projects, so that your requested additions could take some
time to materialize depending on their complexity.

If you foresee Reaktoro could become an essential software component for
the scientific and engineering investigations of your company or
academic group, please consider **financially supporting its
development** — we are always open to new additions to the team!

### Performing benchmark calculations

You have used Reaktoro to perform some calculations for which you have
experimental data (or you have performed similar calculations using
other codes). **We would be very excited if you could share with us your
results!** And if the results you obtained with Reaktoro are not great,
please **make sure we know about this** and we'll be very happy to help
you making your calculations more accurate.

Get in touch with us by going to [Reaktoro's GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/reaktoro/reaktoro/issues/new) and telling us
what you want to share.

### Contributing with documentation and examples

You have used Reaktoro for a while and you want now to contribute with
some examples on how to use it for solving some specific problems. Thank
you for your interest. We appreciate your effort and willingness to
contribute.

Please go to [Reaktoro's GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/reaktoro/reaktoro/issues/new) and write a new issue,

decision in joining forces with us to develop new features, fix bugs,
improve performance, and other tasks you might want to explore.

Before you start working with your contribution, please let us know what
you want to do by going to [Reaktoro's GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/reaktoro/reaktoro/issues/new) and detailing
there your intended development contribution.

By discussing your idea first with us, this promotes a more efficient
