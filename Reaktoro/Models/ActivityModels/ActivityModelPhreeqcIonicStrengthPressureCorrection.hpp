/// Return an activity model that applies an ionic strengh and pressure
/// correction on the activity coefficients of aqueous solutes to produce
/// consistent results with PHREEQC. This is needed because PHREEQC introduces a
/// dependency on ionic strength for the equilibrium constants of reactions and
/// this is incompatible with the design decision in Reaktoro to make these
/// quantities a function of temperature and presssure, not composition. Thus,
/// the ionic strenth correction used in PHREEQC needs to be transfer in
/// Reaktoro to the activity coefficients of the aqueous solutes. Thus, the use
/// of this activity model needs to be done via a chain of activity models. This
/// corrective activity model should be the last one in the chainned model. Example:
/// ~~~c++
/// AqueousPhase solution(speciate("Na Cl C"));
/// solution.setActivityModel(chain(
///     ActivityModelPitzer(),
///     ActivityModelPhreeqcIonicStrengthPressureCorrection(),
/// ));
