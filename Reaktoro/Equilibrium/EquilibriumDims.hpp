/// * @eq{p}, the vector with the *p* control variables;
/// * @eq{q}, the vector with the *q* control variables;
///

/// constraints of *equation type*. These are *temperature* and/or *pressure*, in
/// case they are unknown, as well as the amounts of *explicit titrants* (the
/// substances that we permit in/out of the system).
///
/// The *q* control variables are those variables introduced to enforce
/// constraints of *chemical potential type*. These are *implicit titrants*
/// (also substances allowed in/out of the system) whose amounts need to be
/// found so that the chemical potential constraints are satisfied.
